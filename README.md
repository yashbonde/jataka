PoC for dashboard built specifically for monitoring of ML workloads (training + deployment).

This project has three parts: 

1. Jobs: there are three jobs (image class. training, text class. training, text class. deployment). Each job will have different things that it is going to log for real world behaviour.
2. Server: this is the core because this is what we want to build for efficiency and easy usage
3. Website: the dashboard
